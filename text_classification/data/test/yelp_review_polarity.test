__label__1 , i paid $13 for a less than six inch sandwich with a bit of cold lobster clumps and two tiny slices of avocado in the middle . the whole thing was super greasy and the lobster mixture tasted very creamy . not worth the money . i ' m very disappointed at this item and this truck . 
__label__1 , this place was said to be \busy\ , so i made sure to arrive before opening time at 11 am , expecting a long line outside such as i would have found at matt ' s or five guys . instead , there was no one else , & that was still the case at 11 05 , when the door was still locked , the dining room dark , & the \open\ sign in the window off . \n\nfiguring they had gone out of business , i started my car to drive away , but just then the \open\ sign lighted ( although the dining room remained unlighted during my visit ) . i found a table with enough light to read the magazine i had brought along , but then loud music started playing , so i couldn ' t hear myself think anyway , & it played during my entire visit . \n\nthere were a variety of tacos offered , & a combo including two tacos plus rice & beans was priced ok at $6 . 99 . \vanessa\ brought me a basket of chips & took my order for a combo with a dogfish shark taco & a carne asada one . there were an array of salsas available on an iced table , & i tried several of them with the chips while i waited for the main items . the chips were blah , but the salsas were good , especially the green cilantro one . \n\nthe rest of the food was ok too , but it would have been more enjoyable if it hadn ' t been for the blaring music . forty minutes after i had arrived , i went up to the counter to pay , & one other customer finally entered the restaurant . so much for it being a busy place . \n\nwham ! instead of $6 . 99 , i am being charged $8 . 79 ! what ' s this ? vanessa points out to me that in tiny print at the bottom of the menu it says that if your two tacos aren ' t the same as each other , then it ' s $8 . 79 . that ' s too much for what it was . \n\nback home , i looked at la condesa ' s menu on their website . there , they do tell you up at the top that they will charge you extra for two different tacos , but the new higher price shown there is $7 . 59 , not $8 . 79 . \n\ntoo many problems here , & i ' ll never return , but since the food itself was pretty good , i ' ll bring it up to 2-stars . - ( 
__label__1 , worst customer service ever ! ! ! ! tweaked out employees , the stuff their selling is always badly damage , dirty , food stuck to toys car seats an shoes , no help and not friendly at all ! ! plus they are so cheap when buying your stuff and if there ' s stuff they want they pay you even less ! ! ! i will make the drive to surprise ! ! ! 
__label__2 , visited v bar for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised . great atmosphere and good music . my guests from holland loved it . affordable , fun with good service . jorge , one of the hosts got us a great table and bottle service . thanks for accommodating our large group . it was great start to our night . thanks jorge for a great time . we will definitely come back . 
__label__1 , nous y sommes all\u00e9s hier soir et vraiment mis \u00e0 part les \u00e9normes drink double , le reste du repas laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer . le poulet \u00e9tait br\u00fbl\u00e9 et sec ( ils disent que c ' est la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 du chef pourtant ) et le shish kebad \u00e9tait presque immangeable . c ' est le deuxi\u00e8me fois que nous y allons et ce sera la derni\u00e8re . dommage , les drink vont nous manquer . 
__label__1 , knew it was going to happen ! ! ! ! arrived at advantage on 1/20/14 after reserving a car online a month prior . lo and behold the car we reserved was not available , and there was a problem with gas ? ? ? ? ? we were told to keep checking back for availability or pay additional dollars for a larger vehicle . we already had reserved intermediate vehicle and since there was only 2 of us , we didn ' t require a bigger vehicle . besides , why should we pay more when we already had a car reserved and they did not have the vehicle . we left the counter and walked over to e-z car rental , where we were able to get a larger car for less money - a larger new car ( 15 miles on it ) . \n\nwent back to advantage and told them we did not need the car . i had asked if we were going to get charged anything and the guy behind the counter said we did not pre-pay so no issue . well guess what . . . . . . since you have to give a credit card to reserve , we were charged for 1 day car rental for a car we didn ' t get , that they didn ' t have . what ? ? ? ? ? ? letting the cc company know to dispute the cost ridiculous to get charged for something that was their doing ! \n\nnever say never , but will never rent from them again ! \n\ngo to e-z car rental folks - great customer service , great vehicles . 
__label__1 , an hour and a half wait to be seated for mediocre food . i don ' t think so . not happening in this lifetime . 
__label__1 , don ' t do it ! the food took forever and when my husband ' s steak finally came ( which he had ordered medium rare ) it was well-done . they sent it back and the replacement was tar-tar , absolutely raw inside . the atmosphere was lackluster and the entire experience was bad . 
__label__2 , simply delicious ! i eat at stripsteak on every trip to las vegas . it ' s a very unpretentious steakhouse that serves great food consistently . yes it can be a bit noisy because it is very popular and the layout is very open . the staff has always been very accommodating . the complimentary fry trio you get upon being seated is a nice teaser but they like to tell you they are compliments of the chef . ha ha nice try . everyone gets these and has been for years , they are now the equivalent of chips and salsa at a mexican restaurant . i will however never refuse them , they are yummy . if you aren ' t a big steak eater the chicken is amazing and just the right size . if you get a side of the mac& cheese it ' s extremely rich and satisfying . the lobster fritters are very pricey but unique and tasty , i get them every time . it ' s a perfect appetizer that will not fill you up and a great start before a meal . 
__label__2 , i had the complicated one sandwich . omg the maple bacon jam is fantastic ! the sandwich was huge and came with a small salad . the banana boi bait for dessert was delicious . i will definitely be coming back . 
__label__1 , if you are looking for cheap and accessible . this is it . don ' t expect a whole lot . it ' s a hotel for cheapsters , so you will get what you expect . it isn ' t terrible , but it isn ' t wonderful either . the pool was descent and we went 2 times . the location is great- right on the strip , monorail station inside . 
__label__2 , great brunch ! started with the donut appetizer - the vanilla , chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces are great - but the donuts are also delicious without any sauce . i ordered the crab benedict and my husband ordered the chicken and waffle . as soon as noon rolled around the bartender brought out my bloody mary . i was disappointed that the only garnish was a lemon wedge , i ' m a big fan of traditional ( and creative ) bloody mary toppings . nonetheless , i enjoyed the mix ( not sure if it ' s homemade . ) my husband enjoyed his chicken and waffle , but had to remove a huge melting pond of butter from the middle of the waffle . my crab benedict was fantastic as well , well poached eggs atop an english muffin ( homemade ? ) with a generous pile of lump crabmeat . i especially liked the hollandaise sauce which was particularly lemony , which complemented the crabmeat well . the roasted potatoes that came with the meal were perfectly cooked , soft insides and crispy outside with great seasoning . the food was a little on the pricey side , so we won ' t be regulars , but it was a terrific meal . our server was a bit too nonchalant and actually left the wrong table ' s check with us at first , but everything came out as we ordered it and the food was delicious , so we ' ll overlook it . 
__label__2 , the beans . . . . oh the beans ! and they ' re complimentary . along with the fideo soup . oh , man ! i would eat just that , it makes me so nostalgic for meals from my past . with that said , everything we have tried has been very good . we have been here a few times and have not been disappointed . the parking lot is a hot mess and the seating area is small but once you sit down and they bring the complimentary beans , salsa , chips and soup i am already so happy that i end up ordering a small meal to share with someone ! so if you want to get off the strip and have a good , more authentic mexican meal head over to viva zapatas ! 
__label__1 , i should have listened to my fellow yelpers but i decided to take a chance anyways . . . and what a mistake it was ! \n\nthe hostess was very nice and we were seated right away . the waiter came over and right away he had an attitude . when i asked him if they had any flavored lemonade or iced tea he told me yes . when i asked what flavors they had he told me that they had pink lemonade , which has a lemonade flavor and regular iced tea , which has an iced tea flavor ! so obviously he did not understand my question correctly and his answers were very condescending . \n\ni told him that we needed a few more minutes and to please come back . when he came back we still hadn ' t decided and i could tell that he wasn ' t happy about having to wait for us . instead of being polite and checking back in a few more minutes he decided to have a ten minute conversation with the table next to us completely ignoring us . \n\nafter being talked down to and then ignored we got up to leave and only then the waiter asked if we wanted to order something . i told him no that we were going somewhere else that had better service . he happily smiled and said o . k . \n\ni have never walked out of a restaurant in my life ! but i certainly wasn ' t going to spend my good money to be talked down to and ignored by the waiter . this waiter does not in any way reflect the class of mandalay bay and how such a poor service provider can be employed in a hotel of this class i have no idea . i will not be recommending this restaurant to any one ! 
__label__2 , we are pizza lovers and i have to say papa murphys is by far the best we ' ve ever had ! our favorite are the stuffed pizzas , you won ' t find anything like it around ! 
__label__2 , this is a very unique bakery . a couple of times now i ' ve received cupcakes as gifts of congratulations or thank you . i think they make a great gift especially if you don ' t know what to get someone ! everyone loves cupcakes ! the baked goods are not what you may be used to . they are not going to taste sweet and processed with a lot of sugar . the ingredients taste fresh . i love the coconut ! mmmm ! they also offer breakfast and lunch ! a little hard to find and to park but worth it . something different and fresh and delicious ! 
__label__1 , our worst meal experience ever . the waitress couldn ' t get our order right to save her life , our drink order ! we ordered two lemonades , she drops off two ice waters , so we assume the lemonade is coming . she comes back by a few times so we finally ask if they ' re coming , oh you wanted lemonade ? how many ? i say two and hold up two fingers . she comes back with one . okay fine , we ' ll share . the appetizer wasn ' t very good or hot . then our food came , the buffalo chicken sandwich tasted good . then i take a bite of my mashed potatoes and they were ice cold in the center , like they had thawed out a frozen mound of potatoes . we had to get up and leave , enough was enough ! 
__label__1 , if i could give this place less than a star , i would . this was hands down one of the worst experiences i ' ve had at a restaurant . \n\nwalking in , we were greeted right away , and sat right away . after being seated , we had to wait about 15 minutes until we were even looked at by anyone . finally , we were approached by our waiter , who said he would be with us in a few minutes . what ? ! the fifteen minute wait wasn ' t bad enough ? \n\nwhen he finally came bakc , we ordered our drinks . we all got alcoholic drinks - and i also asked for some tap water to go alone with my meal . upon returning , he brought back water in a glass bottle . now , i ' ve been to restaurants before , where they put their tap water in glass bottles to make it look more fancy - so i thought that ' s what this restaurant did too . wrong . \n\nafter seeing a couple tables next to us , with just regular cups of water , we flagged down our waiter to ask if this was the tap water we had asked for . he said no , and that they charged for each bottle . we asked how much it was for each bottle , and he said he didn ' t know and would go find out . there were two things wrong with this situation \n 1 . how the hell do you not know how much a bottle of water costs ? as a server , you should know your menu inside and out . \n 2 . it took him fifteen minutes to get back to us with a price , which meant we went fifteen minutes without anything to drink , because we had all finished our drinks as well as the water . \n\n0 stars for service . \n\nas for the food , bleh . everything was salty and overcooked . they came by our table at least fifteen times with sausage , but we were only offered their beef items a few times . as for their salad bar , they had a lot of choices , but none of them really worth while . i will say that their chimichurri sauce was pretty good . actually , it was the highlight of the meal . it was the only thing that was actually good . \n\ni would never set foot in this place again . horrible service , and sub par food . you are better off going to fogo de chao or texas de brazil . 
__label__2 , love this place ! i have had the brisket , the beef and cheddar , and the pulled pork . all of them were so good that i thought about them the next day . i wish they had one closer to my house . i also love supporting firefighters and rounding up to donate to their charity . thank you for serving good food ! 
__label__2 , pretty good service , but really busy and noisy ! ! it gets a little overwhelming because the sales people are very knowledgeable and bombard you with useless techy information to i guess impress you ? ? anyways i bought the ipad 3 and it is freaking awesome and makes up for the store . i would give the ipad 3 a gazillion stars if i could . i left it at home today and got really sad when i was driving away . boo hoo ! ! 
__label__1 , serious customer service needs to be implemented ! ! please pt ' s management get in here and make some needed changes . one word that describes the bartenders laxidasical . i want this place to work i live right down the street . great entertainment last night with chris heers . which is the only reason i tried it again . so disappointed in the service from the bartenders . . . just a suggestion teacher your bartenders how to smile and greet the guest . i ' m giving one star for the cold beer . 
__label__1 , washed my car there for the last time , every time i have been there i have selected premium or the works package and every time i have been told the car was done , i have gone around and found spots missed and not cleaned . rims not done , these guys just want a tip but don ' t do good work . lazy crew , owner never around to be found , don ' t know why people still go to the place ? hey owner get some people that take pride in the work they do , stop robbing people . found a new place on durango terrible ' s car wash between trop and peace way , few bucks more but its worth not having to have to point out missed spots every time . don ' t waist your time at this car wash ! 
__label__2 , after my 4th dining experience - 3 chefs tasting ( no menu ) & 1 signature tasting menu i must say sage never disappoints . \n\nwhile waiting for my table we always enjoy a moscow mule ( vodka & ginger beer ) - i now own 4 copper mugs to make this tasty beverage at home . \n\nfor the chefs menu , you can choose how many courses you want with or without the wine paring . the wine selection is right on , courses were timed out well , the beef belly melts in your mouth & the foie gras brulee is to die for ! \n\non my 2nd visit we ordered a non alcoholic pairing for a family member which was awesome . i learned that they could make this accommodation from the bartender the first time . \n\noh , everyone must experience the absinth cart & the fire & ice drink . quite a show , and quite the buzz ! 
__label__1 , saturday i ordered a cheeseburger , 2pc poppers and onion rings . . not only did i wait 10 minutes the fried food were as hard as rocks , and i was given a double cheeseburger and charged for a double cheeseburger and large poppers . \nvery unhappy ! 
__label__2 , love how they have preset portions scooped out in mini pots that you can grab . it ' s a perfect size , not too much and just enough to taste , which is what all buffet goers want , a taste of everything without being full from grabbing too much in the beginning . this buffet is smart , they are saving tons of money from those that grab too much and end up wasting a plateful of food . \n\ncame here for lunch on a weekday , no line , $23 . \n\ni will have to say that some of the asian dishes were not that great . this may be biased since i am asian and know what it should taste like , but i think anyone would agree . the hai gaw ( dim sum shrimp dumpling ) was dry and crumbly , like it was not steamed . the chicken adobe was dry and not edible . \n\ncouldn ' t try everything , but dishes that stood out were the curries , salads and desserts . \n\nthere is a wonderful array of desserts displayed in all colors ! so pretty and tastes just as pretty as it looks ! the desserts saved me from those horrible tasting asian dishes . \n\nservice was good . also loved how the water we get is served in this clean , fresh looking bottle-it tasted good too , not like tap water . 
__label__2 , i don ' t much like the look of this place - i never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty good pizza . \n\ni have eaten trillions of pizzas . maybe more , i lost count . and i ' m not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza . i grew up in chicago , where i was weaned on deep dish , pan , and thin crust pizzas . i lived in nyc for years , and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet . ( for the record , my favorites are difara ' s in brooklyn and coalfire , a relatively young pizza joint in chicago ) . \n\nbrixx does a fine job of the thin crust . we had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks . both were pretty tasty . i ' ll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises . \n\nbut here ' s what they could do a little better \n\nget that oven hotter , and change the flour blend so that there ' s a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust . there ' s an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like , \if that shit don ' t crack , that shit is whack . \ so , when the pizza is folded , the bottom of the crust should crack . ditto for the edge of the crust . ( allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust , like spinach , ricotta , etc . ) \n\nbrixx ' s pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere . it was cooked only to the point of being bread-like . still tasty enough , but not quite there . i hate to sound snotty about this , but i think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning . that crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible . \n\nalso , the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula , but when that was added , the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn ' t melt at all , and the arugula didn ' t wilt . the result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza . \n\npizza aside , they offer local beers , at least one nc wine , and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men ' s room ( i applaud the effort , though that probably won ' t be the highlight of the review ) . \n\nnext time i go in , i ' ll see it they can crispify my pie . 
__label__2 , i have been going to this place since i was a kid . this is hands down the best deep dish pizza in the valley ! \food so good make you want to slap yo mama ! \ \n\nif you like bbq chicken pizza , nellos has the best there is ! 
__label__2 , you want to feel guilty , satisfied and happy come here during the hit of drunken cravings at 2am and its a no fail mmmmmmmm gooooood ! the bacon burritos that i ' ve taken in are badges of pride in the form of plaque in my arteries . totally have accepted it but its alright . clean kitchen from the viewpoints i can observe with speedy service . that ' s all i need . after this review its gonna be time again for another bacon goodness . 
__label__1 , food is good ( not amazing or anything ) but just like any other hole in the wall thai place . this place became trendy and it totally worth going but you will leave thinking that was good but nothing special , then you may be robbed and possibly raped do to the neighborhood this place is in . the service is super slow , they seat way more tables then they can handle per server . 
__label__1 , well . after a five hour drive we had the wonderfully terrible experience of meeting tj at the check in counter . the most unhelpful uninterested person on the planet . the reviews on here are correct , check in is a pain in the you know what and helpful service is apparently not in the employee manual . i haven ' t even seen our room yet . . . . the room was something i would expect to find on fremont street only our hotel there was cleaner , cheaper and much more friendly . the tropicana room smelled weird . like smoke and cleaning fluid and must . overall the bathroom and linens were clean , the tv was a nice flat screen and the bed was comfortable . overall i would not stay here again , the service cast a shadow of ick over our vegas experience . go to the flamingo or mgm instead . 
__label__1 , for the price your better off going to bellagio or the wynn . paid almost $80 for 2 people for thanksgiving last year ( paid for express cause the line was long ! ) . food was below average , only one turkey carving station , slow service . the line for the craving station was blocking the other food sections . we probably didn ' t eat half a plate of food . \n\n i sent them an email and they refunded my money . only way i would visit again is if it was comped . not worth the money when there are so many other great places to eat in vegas . 
__label__2 , great food and beer , what more could you ask for ? great spot to grab dinner with some friends or on a date night . 
__label__2 , great hookah , great ambiance and great , friendly service . we stopped here for a bit wine and hookah and ended up staying for hours and hours . the staff was super friendly and the hookah choices were extensive . the prices vary but the quality is all top-notch . they stay open until 3am and we ended closing up the place . the decor is lovely as well , equipped with a nice lounge area with huge ceilings . c ' etait un bon temp !
